# AforgeWebcam1
This is a windows forms application using .NET Framework 4.7.2
This project uses AForge to stream a camera preview to a picturebox.
This project can be modified to change resolution from a combobox.
The User Interface is designed to be as simple as possible for end users.
  A user would open the program, select camera in the combobox, hit start camera, scan Lot ID barcode, then press save picture to capture the image preview to a file.
If the file cannot be saved, an error message will appear with details.
